# Systems Engineer code challenge

As part of its expansion to new markets, **Door2Door** bought a solution that handles `ticks` information from a small company in Finland. This company had a small team that was reponsible for building tha application and handle hosting and deployment of it.

As part of the deal, we acquired the rights to use the code base as it is in their master repository at the time the deal was closed. You can access the content in the folder called `api` in this repository.

All the knowledge our team has about the project can be found in the [api/README.md](https://github.com/door2door-io/system-engineer-challenge/tree/master/api) file that the developers of that company left behind.


## Objectives

Your mission is to help us to move this application to an infrastructure that we are more comfortable with (Amazon AWS).

Analyse the code base and create a plan for a complete hosting solution based on different AWS services. 

## What we expect from you

We want to be able to use the application live,  directly from the newly setup environment. If it is not deployed by you, we will need all information and scripts that are needed to deploy it ourself. Besides that, we would like to receive a report detailing the decisions behind your approach and any extra information that you might find relevant.

Since this application will be improved by our team, we would like to receive guidelines on how to continue our development with the proper deployment instructions defined by you, without having the risk of breaking anything live.
